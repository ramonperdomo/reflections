How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that as introduced?
	help me the way that i only need to search in the updated parts of my code to find the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the   long term?
	i think that this will help me when i have big files that can confusse me

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	i will don't fear nothing, i can use my old versions like backups for my program

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the  long term?
	i think that saving old versions of my codes will help me with unnecessary changes or errors i did

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	i think because git is a code-orinted editor and google docs doesn't

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs  having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	pros: you can control and personalize your version updates
	cons: you can forgive or not know when you can update your version

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	with git log i can see a resume of my versions and with git diff i can see what exactly changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	i won't fear when i want to see and modify older versions of my program (asuming i will do it responsibly)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	my homework XD
